Test on local Docker host
-------------------------

This project run tests on Travis CI, but we can also run them on local Docker host.
Please check `install`, `before_script`, and `script` sections of `.travis.yml`.
We can use same steps of them for local Docker host.

Local requirements are as follows.

- Ansible (>= 2.0.0)
- Docker (>= 1.10.1)

Notes
-----

- On OSX, role variable `android_sdk_download_url` is ignored. This means that this role DOESN'T install specified version on OSX.
  - Latest SDK is installed when no SDK is installed.
  - If SDK is already installed before this role, this role DOESN'T overwrite it.

- On OSX, role variable `android_home` must be overwritten by path Homebrew installs Android SDK.
  - In default, `/usr/local/opt/android-sdk` will be used.

- On Debian, SDK and related tools are re-installed when new Android SDK is given via `android_sdk_download_url` and `android_sdk_sha1`.
  - In this case, previous installed components in `android_home` are REMOVED. You should be careful!

- About `android_emulator_kvm_user`,
  - On OSX, this is ignored.
  - If this variable is used for Docker, `MKNOD` capability is required. (Ref. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
